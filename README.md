# 🌎 Eniac’s Expansion to Brazil – Data-Driven Market Analysis

## 📖 Case Study Overview
In Fall 2018, Eniac, a Spain-based online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, explored an expansion into Brazil. With pressure from investors to scale globally, the company faced significant challenges:  

- **Lack of local market knowledge**  
- **No logistics partners or supply chain infrastructure**  

To address these gaps, Eniac considered partnering with **Magist**, a Brazilian SaaS company offering order management, logistics, and customer service solutions. However, two critical concerns arose:

1️⃣ **Product-Market Fit** – Could Magist’s infrastructure support Eniac’s premium, high-tech product line?  
2️⃣ **Delivery Reliability** – Would Magist’s reliance on the Brazilian public postal system ensure fast, high-quality delivery?  

This project was part of a **3.5-month intensive Data Analytics Bootcamp** at WBS Coding School. Using Magist’s raw database, we evaluated its strategic fit, analyzed the market landscape, and delivered a data-driven recommendation on whether Eniac should sign a 3-year deal with Magist.

## 💡 Key Findings & Final Recommendation
### Key Findings:
- **Brazil is a promising market**, but logistical challenges exist.  
- **Magist’s infrastructure** is optimized for SMBs, not premium brands.  
- **Delivery reliability is a concern** – 10% of shipments are delayed.  
- **Magist’s pricing model** does not align with Eniac’s premium positioning.  

### Final Recommendation:
📢 **Do not proceed with Magist.**  
🔍 Instead, Eniac should evaluate alternative logistics partners better suited to its premium brand, such as **Intelipost** or **Novatrade Brazil**.

## ⚠️ Key Challenges
- **Information Overload**: Understanding the database and identifying relevant tables took significant time.  
- **Data Relevance**: Filtering out unnecessary information was essential to focus on actionable insights.  
- **Logistical Complexity**: Evaluating delivery reliability and pricing models required careful analysis of multiple variables.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project provided **data-driven clarity** on Eniac’s potential expansion into Brazil. While Brazil offers significant opportunities, Magist’s infrastructure and pricing model are not aligned with Eniac’s premium positioning. The recommendation to **explore alternative logistics partners** ensures Eniac can maintain its brand integrity while scaling globally.
